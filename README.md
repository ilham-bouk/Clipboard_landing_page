## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.<br>
There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/)
